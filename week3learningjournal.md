Learning Journal - Week 3

**Learning Activities**
This week's lecture focused on how to collaborate with others and what expectations we should have for our group members and ourselves as we begin our group activities. We learned what makes a person a good group member and what we should expect from ourselves and others as a result of it.

**Resources**
I learned how to access and operate the site by reading numerous posts on the WordPress forums. Because this work was essentially replicating the site using WordPress, the majority of the content was copied from the prior practical.

**Estimated Hours**
This practical took just over 2 hours to create. A large chunk of this time was spent trying to figure out how to navigate around the WordPress portal since it doesn't include an introductory tutorial and nothing is explained well for new users.

**Content Insights**
The WordPress CMS has a lot of features and is highly customizable, but it is also proprietary. Because of this, The layout is not familiar to new users, so I struggled to know what to do and how to set up my page correctly. It included a lot of what I would call bloat by default spread over many sections and hidden under dropdowns that made it difficult to create a site the way I wanted. Once I figured out the basics, it was easier to get new pages created and so on.
