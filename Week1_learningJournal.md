# Learning Journal - Week 1

## Learning Activities

This week's lecture covered the fundamentals of how websites functioned, including front-end and back-end development, conventions, static vs. dynamic websites, and the fundamentals of HTTP GET, which is used to retrieve websites from the internet. We also learned how widely CMS are used globally, especially with systems like WordPress, and how both non-techies and techies can use them. The majority of this information I was already familiar with from my previous work on web development, but it was helpful to learn more about CMSs as I had never used any before.

## Resources

When creating my site I used refered to the past websites that i developed from my early semsiters and my early projects. I had to refer to other resources such as youtube videos and tutorials from the internet since it has be quite a while since last developed a website.

## Estimated Hours

I spent roughly 2.5 hours on this week's practical. I am already fairly familiar with html,css and I have already exported and uploaded sites like this in the past so getting the site online was pretty quick as well.

## Content Insights

One of the challenges I faced when trying to setup the site was that I've already used up my free trial of sitegrounds from my early day in jcu, since i've used up my free trial i have to find another way to host my webiste. So i had to figure out how to use git hub hosting.
## Career/Employment/Learning Insights

In the past I have chosen to ignore the existence of CMS platforms, preferring the do-it-yourself approach, however seeing the usage of these services (and the demand for developers to work on them) made me realise it's far more deep than I had originally realised.
