**Learning Activities**
In this week's lecture we were talking mostly about how to work with other people and what expectations we should have for our group members and ourselves when we start our group assignments. From it we gained insight in what makes a person a good group member and what we should expect both from ourselves and others.

**Resources/Links**
I used various articles on the Joomla forums such as this to figure out how to navigate and use the site. Most of the content was copied from the previous practical, since this task was basically recreating the site using Joomla.

**Estimated Hours**
This practical took just over 2 hours to create. A large chunk of this time was spent trying to figure out how to navigate around the Joomla portal, since it doesn't include a introductory tutorial and nothing is explained well for new users.

**Content Insights**
The Joomla CMS has a lot of features and is highly customisable, but it is also all proprietary. Because of this, The layout is not familiar to new users, so I struggled to know what to do and how to setup my page correctly. It included a lot of what I would call bloat by default spread over many sections and hidden under dropdowns that made it difficult to create a site the way I wanted. Once I figured out the basics, it was easier to get new pages created and so on.

It was very frustrating trying to create the site coming from a web development background as I couldn't fly through a directory tree writing familiar code as I need, instead trauling through slow dropdowns and redirects to try achieve similar results. To create the pages, It made me write HTML in text boxes, and the only way I could find to easily write the CSS was to add it inline to the HTML, since not even style tags were allowed.

**Career/Employment/Learning Insights**
From this experience I have found that heavily controlled CMS are very difficult to learn and work with. I hope Joomla and other CMS allow for more customisability to work on them, since this approach I find frustrating and not enjoyable.
